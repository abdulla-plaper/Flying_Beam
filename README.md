# Flying Beam

Flying beam technology involves the use of sensors and algorithms to analyze the characteristics of objects passing through a sorting machine. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

**Material feeding**: The sorting machine receives a continuous stream of mixed materials or objects, such as plastic recyclables and are transported along a conveyor belt.

**Reflection and detection**:A beam of light, usually infrared, is projected across the width of the conveyor belt. As the objects pass through the flying beam, they interact with the light. Different materials or objects reflect light differently based on their unique properties, such as color, transparency, or shape.

**Sensor detection**: Sensors positioned on the other side of the conveyor belt detect the reflections and collect data on the objects' characteristics.

**Analysis and decision-making**: The collected data is analyzed by algorithms, which compare the detected characteristics to pre-defined sorting criteria. The algorithms determine the type or category of each object.

**Sorting mechanism**: Based on the analysis, the sorting machine activates appropriate mechanisms, such as air jets or mechanical arms, to divert or separate the objects into different streams or collection bins which can also be replaced by actuators that we currently have.
