# Flying Beam

Flying beam technology involves using sensors and algorithms to analyze the characteristics of objects passing through a sorting machine. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

**Material feeding**: The sorting machine receives a continuous stream of mixed materials or objects, such as plastic recyclables and are transported along a conveyor belt.

**Reflection and detection**: A beam of light, usually infrared, is projected across the width of the conveyor belt. The objects interact with the light as they pass through the flying beam. Different materials or objects reflect light differently based on their unique properties, such as color, transparency, or shape.

**Sensor detection**: Sensors positioned on the other side of the conveyor belt detect the reflections and collect data on the objects' characteristics.

**Analysis and decision-making**: The collected data is analyzed by algorithms, which compare the detected characteristics to pre-defined sorting criteria. The algorithms determine the type or category of each object.

**Sorting mechanism**: Based on the analysis, the sorting machine activates appropriate tools, such as air jets or mechanical arms, to divert or separate the objects into different streams or collection bins which can also be replaced by actuators that we currently have.

Due to the unsuitability of the product offered by TOMRA(INNOSORT FLAKE) for our RVM, which has dimensions of approximately 2 meters in width and weighs 1000kg, we are unable to implement it. Therefore, we will need to undertake a DIY approach to develop and integrate the sensor ourselves.

# What is the difference between our sensor and Flying Beam's sensor?
Both use the same sensor, which is the NIR spectrometer, and along with that Flying Beam uses a color camera to enhance the sorting capabilities, so now it's just up to us to construct a version ourselves.
